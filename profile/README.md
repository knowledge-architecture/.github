**WISSENSARCHITEKTUR – Laboratory of Knowledge Architecture** at the **Dresden University of Technology** is an interdisciplinary think tank conducting research, design, and consultation at the intersection of design and the humanities.

Our lab explores the multiple cross-links between **environmental structures** (spaces, buildings, cities) and **knowledge processes** (innovation, creativity, cooperation). To investigate knowledge dynamics in space, we develop **visualisation and modelling tools** and apply them in **academic training** as well as in **professional practice**.
